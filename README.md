### Hi there! 👋

I am Emmay, software engineer with experience in building full stack web applications implementing technologies such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3, and much more!

I'm also experienced with Git workflow and working in Agile!

I recently finished a 1000+ hours intense bootcamp at App Academy which is highly selective and immersive where I spent more than 80 hours a week honing my technical skills.

When not coding, I'm usually doing the following:

- Going to the gym 🏋️‍♂️
- Trying new food across NYC 🥣
- Going down YouTube rabbit holes of interesting topics 💻

Current Goals:

- Study more DS&A!
- TypeScript
- Python/Django
- GraphQL
